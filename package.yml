summary    : Balances cpu load of interrupts across all of a systems cpus
description: |
    Irqbalance is a daemon to help balance the cpu load generated by
    interrupts across all of a systems cpus. Irqbalance identifies
    the highest volume interrupt sources, and isolates each of them
    to a single unique cpu, so that load is spread as much as possible
    over an entire processor set, while minimizing cache miss rates for
    irq handlers.
